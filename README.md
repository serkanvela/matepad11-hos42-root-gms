# MatePad 11 (2021, DBY-W09): HOS 2 Global → HarmonyOS 4.2.0.208 China, unlocked bootloader kept, APatch root, real Google Play services

A step-by-step record of what worked on **one** Huawei MatePad 11 2021 (DBY-W09, Snapdragon 865, UFS). It is not
a one-click tool, and it was done once, on one unit. Read the whole document before you start.

> **Warning.** This uses Qualcomm EDL, rewrites the partition table (GPT) and the region record (oeminfo), and
> flashes every partition by hand. One wrong sector number can hard-brick the tablet. **All user data is wiped.**
> Take the full EDL backup in [step 2](#2-full-backup-in-edl), keep it on two disks, and do not skip the
> read-back checks. You do this at your own risk.

This builds on **faxcon's** XDA guide
["Comprehensive MatePad 11 2021 (DBY-W09) Rebrand, Update, and Root Guide"](https://xdaforums.com/t/comprehensive-matepad-11-2021-dby-w09-rebrand-update-and-root-guide.4789106/)
and on **scoolo** (4PDA), who found the method. The difference here: I went from **HOS 2.0.0.278 Global (C432)**
straight to **HOS 4.2.0.208 China (C00)** without first installing the HOS 2 China dload package. That needs a new
GPT, which this repository generates from the 4.2 package itself and checks against the device.

## Result

- HarmonyOS 4.2.0.208 (C00E100), Android 12 / API 31. The China firmware includes Turkish, English and other
  languages; pick yours on the first setup screen.
- Bootloader unlocked (orange state). `fastboot oem edl` still works, so EDL stays reachable for recovery.
- Root with APatch (build 11282) and the meta-magic_mount-rs metamodule.
- Real Google Play services, Google Services Framework and Play Store installed as privileged system apps through
  a systemless module built from MindTheGapps 12.1. **Not microG.** The system partition is not modified.

What I checked with adb (not just "it installed"):

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Play services / Play Store as priv-app, updating themselves (GMS 26.41, Play Store 53.6) | Works |
| Google account sign-in, ~50 apps installed from Play Store | Works |
| FCM push connection (`mtalk.google.com:5228` connected) | Works |
| Contacts and calendar sync | Works after [the permission script](#113-runtime-permissions) |
| Netflix DRM | Widevine **L1** (Netflix reports `WIDEVINE_L1`, L1 certificates provisioned) |
| Netflix resolution | **720p measured** (1280×720 buffer, secure H.264 decoder) in the first minute of one title. Longer playback not tested. Prime Video and HBO Max not measured. The panel is 2560×1600, so 4K output is not possible on this tablet anyway. |
| Play Protect certification | **Not certified.** Expected with an unlocked bootloader and root. Nothing is spoofed here. |
| Banking apps / Play Integrity | Not tested. Expect some to refuse to run. |
| Huawei pen (M-Pencil) | Pairs and connects |
| Huawei Smart Magnetic Keyboard | Not working on my unit, but it was already broken before the update, so I can't say whether 4.2 is the cause. |

## What you need

- MatePad 11 2021, model **DBY-W09** (Wi-Fi, Snapdragon 865). Other models (DBY-W09**S** is the Global name of
  the same hardware, see oeminfo below; DBY2, DBR, LTE versions) are **different**: do not use these files on them.
- Windows 10/11 PC (Linux works for edl and fastboot too, but the commands here are for Windows), a USB-C **data**
  cable plugged directly into the PC (no hub).
- About **40 GB** free disk space: ~13 GB EDL backup, ~5 GB firmware zips, ~12 GB extracted images.
- Battery above 60 %.
- A Google account, and some patience.

Each Huawei CDN folder also has a `filelist.xml` (replace the file name at the end of the URL with
`filelist.xml`) that lists the official SHA-256 of every package. I found these links through the firmware
database at pro-teammt.ru (search for DBY-W09). Use `certutil -hashfile <file> SHA256` in Windows to check a hash.

## PC setup

1. Unzip platform-tools to e.g. `C:\platform-tools` and add it to `PATH`, or run adb/fastboot with the full path.
   Check: `adb version`, `fastboot --version`.
2. Install Python. Check: `python --version`.
3. Get bkerler/edl: `git clone https://github.com/bkerler/edl` (or download the ZIP), then
   `python -m pip install -r edl\requirements.txt`. Below, `edl` means `python C:\path\to\edl\edl.py`.
4. Clone this repository next to it: `git clone https://github.com/serkanvela/matepad11-hos42-root-gms`.
5. Make one working folder, e.g. `C:\mp11\`, and put the firehose, the unlock ABL and the firmware zips in it.
6. Close HiSuite completely (also `hwtransport.exe` in Task Manager); it grabs the ADB interface.

In the commands below:

```
set FH=C:\mp11\dbyprog_emmc_firehose
edl <command> --memory=ufs --loader=%FH%
```

Every `edl` call needs `--memory=ufs --loader=%FH%`. I leave it out below to keep the lines short.

## 1. Get to HarmonyOS 2

On HarmonyOS 3.x Global, `adb reboot edl` is ignored and `fastboot oem edl` returns "Command not allowed"
(tested on 3.0.0.216). EDL is only reachable from software on HarmonyOS 2.

- Use HiSuite → "Switch to other version" / system recovery to go back to HarmonyOS 2 (I ended up on
  **2.0.0.278 C432**). **This wipes the tablet**, so back up first (HiSuite backup, photos, etc.).
- If HiSuite offers no older version, faxcon's guide mentions HiSuite Proxy. I didn't need it.
- On HOS 2, enable Developer options (tap the build number 7 times) and USB debugging. Accept the RSA prompt.

## 2. Full backup in EDL

This is the most important step. Without it there is no way back.

1. `adb reboot edl`. The screen stays black. Device Manager shows **QUSB_BULK_CID:0412** (or "QHSUSB_BULK").
2. First time only: open Zadig → Options → List All Devices → select that device → driver **WinUSB** →
   Install Driver.
3. Read every partition except userdata, and the partition tables:

```
edl rl C:\mp11\backup --skip=userdata --genxml
```

   This takes a while (~13 GB, 73 partitions on my unit). It writes one folder per LUN with all partitions and
   `gpt_mainN.bin` / `gpt_backupN.bin` for LUN 0–5.

4. Separately, so you have them at hand:

```
edl r oeminfo C:\mp11\backup\oeminfo_hos2.bin
edl r abl C:\mp11\backup\abl_stock.bin
```

5. Make a hash list and copy the whole `backup` folder to a second disk:

```
cd C:\mp11\backup
certutil -hashfile oeminfo_hos2.bin SHA256
```

   (or `Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File | Get-FileHash` in PowerShell, saved to `SHA256SUMS.txt`).

6. `edl reset` to reboot.

> **If the device stops answering in EDL** (it can happen after an erase): hold **Power + Volume Up + Volume
> Down** until it restarts, then hold **Volume Down** while connected to get into fastboot.

## 3. Unlock the bootloader

1. `adb reboot edl`
2. Write the Huawei-signed unlock ABL:

```
edl w abl C:\mp11\abl_hw865870unlock.elf
edl reset
```

3. Hold **Volume Down** while it restarts (USB connected) to enter fastboot. Check:

```
fastboot getvar unlocked          -> unlocked: yes
fastboot oem lock-state info
```

4. `fastboot reboot`. From now on, **never flash the stock `ABL` image from a package**: it would lock the
   bootloader again, and on 4.2 you may not get back into EDL to undo it. `flashplan.py` skips ABL for this reason.

## 4. Prepare the 4.2 images

1. Check the three zips against the hashes above.
2. Each zip contains one `UPDATE.APP` (Huawei's container). Extract them into separate folders:

```
mkdir C:\mp11\app\base C:\mp11\app\cust C:\mp11\app\preload
tar -xf update_full_base.zip -C C:\mp11\app\base UPDATE.APP
tar -xf update_full_cust_DBY-W09_all_cn.zip -C C:\mp11\app\cust UPDATE.APP
tar -xf update_full_preload_DBY-W09_all_cn_R1.zip -C C:\mp11\app\preload UPDATE.APP
```

3. Extract the partition images from each `UPDATE.APP`:

```
python scripts\updateapp.py C:\mp11\app\base\UPDATE.APP                       (list only)
python scripts\updateapp.py C:\mp11\app\base\UPDATE.APP    C:\mp11\img\base
python scripts\updateapp.py C:\mp11\app\cust\UPDATE.APP    C:\mp11\img\cust
python scripts\updateapp.py C:\mp11\app\preload\UPDATE.APP C:\mp11\img\preload
```

   Names are cut at 16 characters (`ERECOVERY_RAMDIS`, `VBMETA_HW_PRODUC`). `SUPER` comes in two sparse parts,
   `SUPER_0.img` and `SUPER_1.img`. `EFI_0.img` in `img\base` is the 4.2 GPT template used in the next step.

## 5. Build the new GPT

### Why

Several 4.2 images do not fit the HOS 2 Global partition layout:

| Image | Needs | Old partition |
|---|---|---|
| `VERSION` (cust, sparse) | 576 MiB | 32 MiB |
| `RECOVERY_RAMDISK`, `ERECOVERY_RAMDISK` | 36 MiB | 32 MiB |

faxcon's route avoids this by installing the HOS 2 China dload package first, which rewrites the GPT. Here the
GPT is generated from the 4.2 template (`EFI_0.img`, 11 sectors per LUN) instead. On my unit only two LUNs change:

- **LUN0:** partitions after `erecovery_ramdisk` move. `super` 1 927 168 → 1 878 016 sectors, `version`
  8 192 → 147 456, `preas` 262 144 → 75 776, and **`userdata` moves from LBA 2 829 824 to 2 733 568**. That move
  is why all data is lost.
- **LUN4:** `secdata` shrinks to 7 sectors and a new `dfx` partition is added. On my unit everything in `secdata`
  after its first 7 sectors was zero, so nothing was lost. **Check yours** (the `secdata` file in your backup)
  before going on.
- LUN 1, 2, 3 and 5 do not change.

### How `gptmake.py` works

- It takes the 4.2 template entries for one LUN.
- It keeps your device's disk GUID and the unique GUIDs of partitions with the same name, including the
  `last_parti` sentinel entry. New partitions get random GUIDs.
- It grows the last partition to the device's last usable LBA. That is Huawei's own rule: with it, the script
  reproduces the unchanged LUN 1/2/3/5 GPTs of my device **byte for byte**, CRCs included.
- It checks bounds and overlaps and writes three files: `_primary.bin` (LBA 0–5), `_bakent.bin` (backup entries,
  4 sectors) and `_bakhdr.bin` (backup header, 1 sector).

### Steps

1. **Self-test first.** Run it on the LUNs that should not change. All four must print `SAME`:

```
python scripts\gptmake.py C:\mp11\img\base\EFI_0.img 1 C:\mp11\backup\lun1\gpt_main1.bin x --selftest
python scripts\gptmake.py C:\mp11\img\base\EFI_0.img 2 C:\mp11\backup\lun2\gpt_main2.bin x --selftest
python scripts\gptmake.py C:\mp11\img\base\EFI_0.img 3 C:\mp11\backup\lun3\gpt_main3.bin x --selftest
python scripts\gptmake.py C:\mp11\img\base\EFI_0.img 5 C:\mp11\backup\lun5\gpt_main5.bin x --selftest
```

   (The folder names under `backup` depend on the edl version; use wherever `gpt_mainN.bin` was saved.)
   If any of them says `DIFFERENT`, **stop**: your device differs from mine and the generated GPT can't be trusted.

2. **Find where your backup GPT entries are.** On LUN0 of my unit the backup entries are **not** at
   "backup header − 4"; they start right after the last usable LBA. Read your own backup header:

```
python scripts\gptinfo.py C:\mp11\backup\lun0\gpt_main0.bin
```

   Note "other header LBA" (= backup header, `B0`). Then, in EDL, read that one sector:

```
edl rs <B0> 1 C:\mp11\gpt\bakhdr0_orig.bin --lun=0
python scripts\gptinfo.py C:\mp11\gpt\bakhdr0_orig.bin
```

   "entries at LBA" is your backup-entries LBA (`E0`). On my unit: `B0` = 30 693 375, `E0` = 30 692 864.
   Do the same for LUN4 (`B4`, `E4`; on mine 524 287 and 524 283).

3. Generate LUN0 and LUN4:

```
mkdir C:\mp11\gpt
python scripts\gptmake.py C:\mp11\img\base\EFI_0.img 0 C:\mp11\backup\lun0\gpt_main0.bin C:\mp11\gpt\lun0 --backup-entries-lba=<E0>
python scripts\gptmake.py C:\mp11\img\base\EFI_0.img 4 C:\mp11\backup\lun4\gpt_main4.bin C:\mp11\gpt\lun4 --backup-entries-lba=<E4>
```

4. Look at the result and note the new start of `metadata` and `userdata`:

```
python scripts\gptinfo.py C:\mp11\gpt\lun0_primary.bin
```

   Mine: `metadata` first 255 488 (4 096 sectors), `userdata` first 2 733 568.

5. **Check that every image fits** and generate the flash script. Copy the unchanged `gpt_main1/2/3/5.bin`
   next to the new `lun0_primary.bin` / `lun4_primary.bin` first:

```
copy C:\mp11\backup\lun1\gpt_main1.bin C:\mp11\gpt\
copy C:\mp11\backup\lun2\gpt_main2.bin C:\mp11\gpt\
copy C:\mp11\backup\lun3\gpt_main3.bin C:\mp11\gpt\
copy C:\mp11\backup\lun5\gpt_main5.bin C:\mp11\gpt\
python scripts\flashplan.py C:\mp11\img C:\mp11\gpt C:\mp11\flash42.ps1
```

   It prints a table of image → partition with sizes and must end without any `PROBLEM` line (44 writes on my
   unit). Run it once with your **old** GPT folder as a sanity check: it should report exactly the three
   overflows from the table above.

## 6. Build the new oeminfo

The region and model live in oeminfo. The Global unit says `hw/eu` and `DBY-W09S`; the China firmware expects
`all/cn` and `DBY-W09`. `oeminfo_region.py` changes exactly those two records (9 bytes on my unit) and leaves
everything else alone.

Use a **fresh** oeminfo dump, read right before writing, not an old backup: some runtime records change (mine
differed from the morning backup in 128 bytes). In EDL:

```
edl r oeminfo C:\mp11\oeminfo_now.bin
python scripts\oeminfo_region.py C:\mp11\oeminfo_now.bin C:\mp11\oeminfo_cn.bin
```

It lists the old values and must print `changed bytes: 9` (or a similar small number). Anything large means
something is wrong.

## 7. Write GPT and oeminfo in EDL

Do this in one EDL boot, in this order, and check each read-back before going on. `<B0>`, `<E0>`, `<B4>`, `<E4>`
are your values from step 5.

```
adb reboot edl

:: a. save the current GPT sectors (for going back)
edl rs 0 6 C:\mp11\gpt\orig_lun0_primary.bin --lun=0
edl rs <E0> 4 C:\mp11\gpt\orig_lun0_bakent.bin --lun=0
edl rs <B0> 1 C:\mp11\gpt\orig_lun0_bakhdr.bin --lun=0
edl rs 0 6 C:\mp11\gpt\orig_lun4_primary.bin --lun=4
edl rs <E4> 4 C:\mp11\gpt\orig_lun4_bakent.bin --lun=4
edl rs <B4> 1 C:\mp11\gpt\orig_lun4_bakhdr.bin --lun=4

:: b. oeminfo, then read it back and compare hashes
edl w oeminfo C:\mp11\oeminfo_cn.bin
edl r oeminfo C:\mp11\check_oeminfo.bin

:: c. GPT, then read back and compare hashes
edl ws 0     C:\mp11\gpt\lun0_primary.bin --lun=0
edl ws <E0>  C:\mp11\gpt\lun0_bakent.bin  --lun=0
edl ws <B0>  C:\mp11\gpt\lun0_bakhdr.bin  --lun=0
edl ws 0     C:\mp11\gpt\lun4_primary.bin --lun=4
edl ws <E4>  C:\mp11\gpt\lun4_bakent.bin  --lun=4
edl ws <B4>  C:\mp11\gpt\lun4_bakhdr.bin  --lun=4
edl rs 0 6 C:\mp11\gpt\check_lun0.bin --lun=0
edl rs 0 6 C:\mp11\gpt\check_lun4.bin --lun=4
edl printgpt --lun=0
edl printgpt --lun=4

:: d. wipe the start of metadata and userdata at their NEW locations
edl es <metadata first> 4096 --lun=0
edl es <userdata first> 16384 --lun=0

:: e. reboot into fastboot: hold Volume Down
edl reset
```

Compare `certutil -hashfile` of each `check_*` file with the file you wrote (`check_oeminfo.bin` vs
`oeminfo_cn.bin`, `check_lun0.bin` vs `lun0_primary.bin`, and so on). If a hash differs, write it again and do
not leave EDL until they match.

Step d makes Android treat metadata and userdata as empty. On my unit `es <metadata first> 4096` and
`es 2733568 16384` (the first 64 MiB of userdata) were enough. The firehose stopped answering after the userdata
erase: see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## 8. Flash HarmonyOS 4.2 in fastboot

You must be in **bootloader fastboot**, not fastbootd:

```
fastboot getvar is-userspace     -> is-userspace: no
fastboot getvar unlocked         -> unlocked: yes
```

Then run the generated script in PowerShell:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\mp11\flash42.ps1
```

The script checks `is-userspace: no` before **every** write, stops at the first error and never writes ABL. It
skips ABL, the GPT template (EFI/FI), the package tables (PTABLE_*), CRC, signature and version records.

Big sparse images (`super`, `preload`) "finish" in milliseconds. That is normal: this ABL reports
`parallel-download-flash: yes` and writes in the background. I read back samples of `super` in EDL afterwards and
they matched the image.

When it ends: `fastboot getvar unlocked` (still `yes`) → `fastboot reboot`.

## 9. First boot

On my unit the first boot looped, and the last kernel log said `/data mount fail`: Huawei's init does not
format a wiped userdata by itself. Fix:

1. Get to fastboot (Volume Down while it restarts) → `fastboot reboot recovery`.
2. In recovery choose **Wipe data / factory reset** and confirm.
3. It boots into the Chinese setup screen. Select your language in the first screen; the rest is in that language.

Check in Settings → About: `4.2.0.208(C00E100)`. `fastboot oem lock-state info` should still say unlocked.

## 10. Root with APatch

1. Enable Developer options and USB debugging again.
2. Install the APatch APK (`adb install APatch_....apk`).
3. Copy the 4.2 boot image you extracted: `adb push C:\mp11\img\base\BOOT_0.img /sdcard/Download/`
4. APatch → **Patch** → select `BOOT_0.img` → set a **SuperKey** (remember it) → start. The output lands in
   `/sdcard/Download/apatch_patched_*.img`.
5. Flash it:

```
adb pull /sdcard/Download/apatch_patched_XXXX.img C:\mp11\boot_patched.img
adb reboot bootloader
fastboot flash boot C:\mp11\boot_patched.img
fastboot reboot
```

6. Open APatch, enter the SuperKey, and install AndroidPatch (`apd`) when it offers.
7. Modules → install `magic_mount_rs-4.0.12-941-arm64.zip` → **reboot**. APatch needs this metamodule before it
   mounts any other module.

faxcon's Drive folder also has a pre-patched `bootHMOS4.2.img`. I patched the boot from the official package
myself instead, so I know what's in it.

## 11. Google Play services

### 11.1 Build and install the module

The module is a minimal subset of MindTheGapps 12.1 arm64: GmsCore, Google Services Framework, Play Store
(Phonesky), GooglePartnerSetup, the contacts/calendar sync adapters, and the privapp-permission and sysconfig XMLs
they need. No setup wizard, no Velvet, no extra apps. The files are copied byte for byte from the official zip.

```
python scripts\build_gms_module.py MindTheGapps-12.1.0-arm64-20231025_200924.zip gms12_systemless.zip
adb push gms12_systemless.zip /data/local/tmp/
adb shell su -c "/data/adb/apd module install /data/local/tmp/gms12_systemless.zip"
adb reboot
```

(Or install the zip from APatch → Modules.)

Why these paths: on HOS 4.2 `/product` and `/system_ext` are symlinks into `/system`, so the module must use
`system/product/...` and `system/system_ext/...`. `ro.control_privapp_permissions=enforce` is set, so the
permission XMLs have to be complete; Android refuses to start system_server when a priv-app permission is missing from them.

Check after reboot:

```
adb shell pm list packages -s | findstr google
adb shell dumpsys package com.google.android.gms | findstr "versionName privapp"
```

### 11.2 Register the device

An uncertified device has to be registered before Google sign-in works reliably.

1. Open Play Store once and wait a minute so GSF creates its ID.
2. Read the GSF ID:

```
adb shell su -c "cp /data/data/com.google.android.gsf/databases/gservices.db /sdcard/Download/"
adb pull /sdcard/Download/gservices.db
python -c "import sqlite3;print(sqlite3.connect('gservices.db').execute(\"select value from main where name='android_id'\").fetchone()[0])"
adb shell rm /sdcard/Download/gservices.db
```

3. Enter that number at Google's official page <https://www.google.com/android/uncertified> while signed in with
   the account you'll use on the tablet.
4. Wait (minutes to an hour), then add the account in Settings → Accounts. Play Store updates GMS by itself.

### 11.3 Runtime permissions

Without these, contacts and calendar don't sync:

```
adb push scripts\grant-runtime-permissions.sh /data/local/tmp/
adb shell su -c "sh /data/local/tmp/grant-runtime-permissions.sh"
```

## 12. After setup

- **Chinese keyboard:** install Gboard from Play Store and set it as the default input method.
- **Chinese apps:** remove them with `adb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 <package>` only. That removes them for
  the user and nothing is deleted from the system partition, so `adb shell cmd package install-existing <package>`
  brings any of them back. Keep `com.huawei.android.thememanager` if you want themes.
- **Time zone:** it starts on Asia/Shanghai. Settings → System → Date & time: turn off automatic time zone and
  pick yours.
- **AdAway:** `/system` is read-only (erofs), so AdAway's root mode needs a systemless hosts module (a module with
  `system/etc/hosts`).
- **Apps using MicroG (ReVanced-type):** Huawei's launch manager stops other apps from starting MicroG. Settings →
  Battery → App launch → MicroG → Manage manually, and enable all three switches.
- **Never accept OTA or HiSuite updates.** They rewrite bootloader components, may bring back the stock ABL, and
  4.2 offers no software way into EDL if the bootloader is locked.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What helped |
|---|---|
| Firehose stops answering (after an erase, or a long pause) | Hold Power + Volume Up + Volume Down until it restarts, then Volume Down for fastboot, or `adb reboot edl` again. |
| `adb reboot edl` just reboots normally | You're on HOS 3.x Global. Go back to HOS 2 first (step 1). On 4.2 with an unlocked bootloader use `fastboot oem edl`. |
| EDL device shows with a yellow mark / edl can't open it | Install WinUSB with Zadig on QUSB_BULK_CID:0412. |
| `adb` says "unauthorized" or device not found | Close HiSuite and kill `hwtransport.exe`. |
| PowerShell 5.1 treats fastboot output as an error | fastboot writes progress to stderr. The generated script handles this; don't change `$ErrorActionPreference` to `Stop`. |
| Bootloop with `/data mount fail` after flashing | Step 9: `fastboot reboot recovery` → factory reset. |
| Git Bash turns `/sdcard/...` into `C:/Program Files/Git/sdcard/...` | Use cmd/PowerShell, or `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` in Git Bash. |
| Contacts / calendar don't sync | Run the permission script (11.3). |
| Play Store says "device not certified" | Expected. Registration (11.2) is what makes sign-in work; certification stays off. |

## Going back

- **Remove only GMS (keep root):** first uninstall the updates of Play Store and Play services in Settings → Apps,
  then APatch → Modules → remove the module → reboot.
- **Remove root:** `fastboot flash boot C:\mp11\img\base\BOOT_0.img` (the unpatched 4.2 boot).
- **Back to HOS 2 Global (all from your backup, in EDL):** write the saved original GPT sectors back to the same
  LBAs (`orig_*.bin` from step 7a), write the original oeminfo, then restore the LUN0/LUN4 partitions from the
  backup (`edl wl C:\mp11\backup\lun0 --lun=0 --skip=userdata` etc. — check the edl help for your version).
  You end up on your HOS 2.0.0.278 with the data wiped.
- **Re-locking the bootloader:** only with the stock boot **and** the stock ABL back in place. Never lock with a
  patched boot.

## Scripts in this repository

All scripts only read their inputs and write new files. None of them talks to the device.

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`scripts/updateapp.py`](scripts/updateapp.py) | Lists or extracts the images in a Huawei `UPDATE.APP`. |
| [`scripts/gptinfo.py`](scripts/gptinfo.py) | Prints a GPT header and partition list from a dump (4096-byte sectors). |
| [`scripts/gptmake.py`](scripts/gptmake.py) | Builds a device-specific GPT for one LUN from the 4.2 template; `--selftest` compares against an unchanged LUN. |
| [`scripts/oeminfo_region.py`](scripts/oeminfo_region.py) | Changes the oeminfo region/model records to `all/cn` / `DBY-W09`. |
| [`scripts/flashplan.py`](scripts/flashplan.py) | Maps images to partitions of the new GPT, checks sizes, writes the PowerShell flash script. |
| [`scripts/build_gms_module.py`](scripts/build_gms_module.py) | Builds the systemless GMS module from the official MindTheGapps 12.1 zip (checks its hash). |
| [`scripts/grant-runtime-permissions.sh`](scripts/grant-runtime-permissions.sh) | Grants the runtime permissions the Google sync adapters need. |
